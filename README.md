## Hi there 👋
Hi everyone! My name is Ruben Arevalo, and I am a software engineer from McAllen, Texas. 

I am 23 years old, and I was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) for my entire life, having earned my associate's degree in computer science from **South Texas College**, my high school diploma from **Achieve Early College High School**, and my bachelor's degree in computer engineering--with a concentration in software development--from the **University of Texas - Rio Grande Valley**. 

I am currently interested in the following fields:
- Software Engineering 🧑‍💻
- Full-Stack Development 📚
- Artificial Intelligence & Deep/Machine Learning 🤖

Outside of coding, which is also one of my hobbies, I love to listen to music 🎵, watch TV shows, movies, and anime 🎥📺, and spend time with my family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
